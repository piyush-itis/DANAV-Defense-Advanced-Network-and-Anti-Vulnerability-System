## Introduction

DANAV is a decentralized "Defence Advanced Network and Anti Vulnerability" application deployed on the *Polygon Mumbai Testnet*. It uses a unique encryption algorithm that combines the Defence Minister, Head Army Personal's, Head Navy Personal's, Head Air Force Personal's key with an individual's UIC to generate an encryption key and short one word key to create master encryption key. This master encryption key is further used by an Army/Navy/Airforce personal to access their account.
